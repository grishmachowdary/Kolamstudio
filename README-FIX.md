# Fix Notes

This corrected version downgrades React to 18 for compatibility with `vaul` and other dependencies.

## Steps to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

Your app should now run without dependency errors.
